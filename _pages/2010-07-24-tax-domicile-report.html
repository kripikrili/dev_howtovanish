<p><span style="line-height: 120%; font-family: times; color: green; font-size: xx-large;">Do you pay thousands of dollars every year in state income taxes? </span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 120%; font-family: times; color: green; font-size: xx-large;">Do you want to pay less taxes?</span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 120%; font-size: medium;">If you answered "yes" to either or both of these questions, I've got good news for you.</span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 120%; font-size: medium;">For the first time ever, I am sharing how to reduce your state income taxes by thousands of dollars a year, and may even reduce it to $0. I have created a complete guide that combines a comprehensive strategy with all of the specific tactics you need to eliminate your state income tax. </span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 120%; font-size: medium;">I don't think anybody has ever offered this kind of thing to the public before. This guide will show you the business decisions that could also result in legally slashing your state income tax bill, so that you might end up owing no state income taxes at all!</span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 120%; font-size: medium;">Imagine if you were able to keep all the money that you paid in state income taxes each year. How much would you save every year? Now, what if you never had to pay state income taxes ever again for the rest of your life? How much would you save over your lifetime? </span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 120%; font-size: medium;">This could potentially save you hundreds of thousands, or maybe even millions of dollars over the course of your lifetime! Maybe more!</span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 120%; font-family: times; color: green; font-size: xx-large;">We all want lower taxes.</span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 120%; font-size: medium;">If you are anything like me you want to spend your own money on the things <em>you</em> want, when <em>you</em> want, with the people that <em>you</em> want to be with; after all, <em>you</em> earned it. You want to enjoy your successes with your friends and family. And I’m sure you would like more money to increase your investments, secure your savings and to grow your wealth.</span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 120%; font-size: medium;">Some of you who have already worked hard and worked smart throughout your entire life and have accumulated some wealth and are ready to enjoy it with your family and hopefully protect it and pass it on to them.</span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 120%; font-size: medium;">All of you want to do this without fear that it will be taxed away. Plus, you don't want to have to always look over your shoulder to make sure that there is no new regulation, tax, or a clerical error that could jeopardize any of it. And you want to do it while staying under the radar and not drawing any unwanted attention to your life. The main reason for doing any of the things described in this guide are to protect your privacy and the privacy of your family, prevent identity theft and reduce exposure to frivolous litigation. They have the beneficial side effect of saving you thousands of dollars in taxes.</span></p>
<p>[HTML6]</p>
<p><span style="line-height: 120%; font-family: times; color: green; font-size: xx-large;">Taxes Endanger Your Wealth And Well Being</span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 120%; font-size: medium;">But this world where you spend your own money how and when you choose is definitely not the world we live in right now. Taxes cost you a lot of money. The multitude of taxes and regulations make most otherwise excellent businesses unprofitable. </span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 120%; font-size: medium;">Your cost of doing business has gone through the roof because of the need to comply with all of these asinine and useless taxes. The record keeping alone might make your otherwise profitable venture bleed cash unnecessarily. And taxes make hiring employees a daunting thought for anyone who already has a business. One fourth of Americans pay more than 8% of their total income in state income taxes. Some as high as 11%.</span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 120%; font-family: times; color: green; font-size: xx-large;">New Taxes And New Ways Of Collecting Taxes Are Dreamed Up Every Day</span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 120%; font-size: medium;">The Health Care Bill will make you fill out a 1099 form for every place you spend more than $600 in cash in a year. Might as well have to check in with the IRS whenever you get home at night like mom used to do when you were in high school.</span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 120%; font-size: medium;">In most places, you must register and pay a fee for a license to sell fresh milk. Fresh milk, one of the most basic food items I can think of! And there are dozens of other kinds of foods, herbs and fresh products that are regulated, restricted and taxed so you can’t get them, even if you can pay for them.</span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 120%; font-size: medium;">The city of Philadelphia taxes bloggers $300 for a business license.</span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 120%; font-size: medium;">Colorado tries to collect taxes through Amazon.com affiliates, so Amazon just shuts down all Amazon based affiliates.</span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 120%; font-size: medium;">In most states you have to pay income tax on your worldwide income, regardless of whether or not you ever bring that money into that state.</span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 120%; font-size: medium;">Did you sell several items on eBay, Craigslist, Half.com or some other website? You may owe tax on those items too.</span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 120%; font-size: medium;">For others who don’t live in states with burdensome taxes, you are at risk of accidentally owing taxes in high tax states because of some meaningless and fleeting activity that you may have engaged in there.</span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 120%; font-family: times; color: green; font-size: xx-large;">What Are High Taxes Doing To You?</span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 120%; font-size: medium;">All of these states are keeping track of you and what you do through the various taxes, licenses, regulations, registrations, fees, and reporting requirements. Who knows why they care so much about the milk you drink?</span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 120%; font-size: medium;">These parasitic tax systems are destroying your wealth and prosperity if you happen to be under their rule. Your talent is being choked out. The security of any wealth that you have built is at risk. Your economic choices and freedom is limited. It is hardly worth your effort to work a little harder to earn a little bit more, because it will not yield you enough value.</span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 120%; font-size: medium;">States are also increasing tax collection. Compliance with obscure and unheard of taxes will only increase in the near future as states face fiscal disasters across the country. They will be making sure you comply as much as anyone else.</span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 120%; font-size: medium;">You are forced to support government programs that are failing. You are forced to support more than 50% of the US population that pays no income tax at all. You are forced to bail out criminals, and there is almost nothing you can do about it. And all of that is just the tip of the iceberg.</span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 120%; font-family: times; color: green; font-size: xx-large;">The Dangerous Myth That Is Costing You Thousands</span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 120%; font-size: medium;">So many people carry these tax and regulatory burdens around their neck like a bunch of lead weights. You could achieve so many more of the things you want in your life if you didn't have them. But you haven’t dropped them to swim free.</span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 120%; font-size: medium;">Maybe you haven’t dropped them because you aren’t aware that you can? Maybe its because you know you can but you don’t know how? And maybe you know how, but you are afraid of what might happen if you try?</span></p>
<p>[HTML4]</p>
<p><span style="line-height: 120%; font-size: medium;">You are probably afraid to rock the boat because you don’t want to become the victim of arbitrary enforcement of draconian laws. A zealous prosecutor could successfully prosecute almost any American for violating some kind of obscure and vague law. </span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 120%; font-size: medium;">Take the example of an Ohio woman who bought two packages of cold medicine for her sick family members in one week. She was convicted of a crime designed to prevent the production of drugs. That kind of overzealous, unintended application of the law threatens anyone who does something to call attention to themselves. With that kind of punishment, who wants to get on anyone’s radar.</span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 120%; font-family: times; color: green; font-size: xx-large;">The Secret To Successful Tax Reduction</span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 120%; font-size: medium;">I know it all sounds way too good to be true, but I am going to let you in on a powerful secret. There is a simple way to reduce your state income taxes. In many cases, you can reduce it to $0. It all hinges on a single issue: Tax Domicile. </span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 120%; font-size: medium;">This guide shows you exactly what Tax Domicile is, how it causes you to pay thousands of dollars in state income tax, and how you can use it to completely eliminate your state income taxes. And I am going to show you that it’s a lot easier than you think!</span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 120%; font-size: medium;">What makes this approach so different is that it actually incorporates the successes of hundreds of others, and shows you how to avoid the mistakes that hundreds of others have made, to make this the most comprehensive, solid, and successful tax saving strategy possible.</span></p>
<p>[HTML6]</p>
<p><span style="line-height: 120%; font-family: times; color: green; font-size: xx-large;">Others Have Already Saved Millions</span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 120%; font-size: medium;">You may have never heard the term “tax domicile” before. Even if you have been paying state income taxes for years, it is one of those things that is just so obvious nobody ever really talks about it. But it’s a concept that very wealthy people have known about for years and they’ve been using it to save a lot of money.</span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 120%; font-size: medium;">Tiger Woods is famous for a lot of things, but few people talk about one of the smartest things he has ever done. He carefully selected his tax domicile to save an estimated $100 million over the course of his career. At this point he is going to need that for a lot more than a new set of golf clubs.</span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 120%; font-size: medium;">Lebron James might be following this strategy, based on some of his recent actions. If he does it right, he will save himself millions of dollars a year.</span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 120%; font-size: medium;">Lots of wealthy former New Jersey residents have also used this strategy to protect up to $70 billion that the state of New Jersey can’t tax. The people who have saved this much on state income taxes have done it completely legally.</span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 120%; font-family: times; color: green; font-size: xx-large;">How You Can Save Thousands of Dollars</span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 120%; font-size: medium;">But you don't have to be nearly as wealthy as these people to profit from this guide. In my law practice, I help clients who are probably a lot more like you. You’ll discover exactly how a middle class income can save thousands of dollars a year. You will learn how to maximize your benefit and save as much money as possible.</span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 120%; font-size: medium;">Everything you need to know to safely, legally and effectively save a lot of money on state income taxes is revealed in complete detail. Here's an overview of what's included in this comprehensive guide:</span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 120%; font-family: times; color: green; font-size: xx-large;">Some Benefits Of This Powerful Strategy</span></p>
<p>◆ Save money by reducing, or even eliminating your state income taxes. For some people this could be 8-11% of their total income.</p>
<p><span style="line-height: 120%; font-size: medium;"> ◆ Enjoy a higher standard of living for you and your family because of the increased time, money, or both.</span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 120%; font-size: medium;"> ◆ Save time. The hard work of developing this amazing strategy is already done. You just have to go through and apply the simple steps. The process is as streamlined and stress free as possible.</span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 120%; font-size: medium;"> ◆ Have no worries. This guide is based entirely in the law so you do not have to worry about being caught doing things that you aren't supposed to be doing or given undue attention.</span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 120%; font-size: medium;"> ◆ Experience greater financial freedom. Being able to save that much on taxes puts more money in your pocket to achieve your financial goals much, much quicker.</span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 120%; font-size: medium;"> ◆ Avoid making the huge mistakes that most people make. Hundreds of people have made big mistakes with their tax domicile. This guide will show you how to avoid making those mistakes yourself.</span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 120%; font-size: medium;"> ◆ Learn the hidden secrets to be the most cost efficient possible. You could easily spend 5 or 10 times more than necessary if you don’t know the where to spend money and where to conserve. This guide shows you exactly how to do as much as possible for next to nothing. It will not cost you a dime more than you need to spend.</span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 120%; font-size: medium;"> ◆ Minimal disruption. Most people who change their domicile go about it in completely the wrong way by uprooting their entire lives to save on taxes. That is like using a clumsy axe to perform delicate surgery. This guide is the surgeon's scalpel that shows you how to maximize your benefits without unnecessarily disrupting your life.</span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 120%; font-size: medium;"><span style="line-height: 120%; font-size: medium;">◆ Enjoy more time with friends and family. You won't have to work as hard to pay the bills when you remove a huge part of your tax burden. You will have more time to spend with your loved ones, provide better for them, or both.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 120%; font-size: medium;"> ◆ Secure your financial future. This guide shows you how to reduce your exposure to high tax jurisdictions which threaten your sources of income from investments, income and savings.</span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 120%; font-size: medium;"> ◆ Avoid accidental tax liabilities. Accidental exposure to a state with high taxes could create some serious tax liabilities for you. This guide will show you exactly how to avoid being accidentally domiciled in a high tax state.</span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 120%; font-size: medium;"> ◆ One simple technique which shows you how to reduce the likelihood of domicile audits. This gives you so much more confidence knowing that you are less likely to even have to go through with the horrible audit process.</span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 120%; font-size: medium;"> ◆ Benefit from the time value of money. $5,000 paid in taxes today, compounded at 10% for 40 years would be $2.2 million! Imagine how much you will be saving when you are on the winning side of that equation rather than paying that money in state income taxes.</span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 120%; font-size: medium;"> ◆ Discover just how easy this strategy is to understand and master.</span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 120%; font-size: medium;"> ◆ Learn how to apply one of the single most powerful tactics that will save more in taxes than any other.</span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 120%; font-size: medium;"> ◆ See how these principles will be adaptable to almost any situation.</span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 120%; font-size: medium;"> ◆ References to tons of cases, statutes and the proper tax forms to reduce the work that you, your attorneys and accountants need to do to implement this strategy. I have already put together hours of research so your attorney or accountant doesn't have to do those hours of research. Every hour that they don't need to bill you saves you hundreds of dollars.</span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 120%; font-size: medium;"> ◆ Be confident that you can verify that the strategy is completely within the law.</span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 120%; font-size: medium;"> ◆ Learn what aspects of this strategy are the most risky and what will not raise any red flags. Some people may want to save even more by using a more aggressive approach. This guide helps you manage your own risk tolerance by showing you where there is potential to be more aggressive and what the risk is of doing so.</span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 120%; font-size: medium;"> ◆ Get the training on strategies and tactics to effectively wield this strategy like a ninja wields a sword. Otherwise, you are wielding a risky dangerous weapon without any training at all.</span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 120%; font-size: medium;"> ◆ Harness the power of billionaires. The reason only billionaires and multi millionaires have used this strategy before is because they were the only ones who could afford to investigate the issue. This guide lets you get 95% of the way done. You only need to get the final approval from a local attorney costing you much, much less than it otherwise would be.</span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 120%; font-size: medium;"> ◆ Avoid having to fund failing and unproductive government institutions. Avoid being a part of bail outs for criminals. Avoid throwing good money after bad. Avoid destroying wealth and prosperity.</span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 120%; font-size: medium;"> ◆ Enjoy more of the fruits of your own labor with your friends and family and protect more of it to pass on to future generations.</span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 120%; font-size: medium;"> ◆ Stay under the radar. This guide is the best way to fly under the radar of state taxing authorities because it literally shows you exactly what they are looking for!</span></p>

<p><span style="line-height: 120%; font-size: medium;">That is only a partial overview of what is in the State Income Tax Optimization Guide. There's actually a whole lot more than I have room to cover here, but you get the picture. </span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 120%; font-size: medium;">The important thing is this: there is a never before shared strategy that you can use to enjoy the success that you already have in your life. State Income Tax Optimization gives you all you need to reduce your taxes by as much as 11% of your annual income.</span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 120%; font-size: medium;">This strategy and the techniques have already helped people like Tiger and the New Jersey wealthy to save millions of dollars every year in taxes. And the great thing is, the strategy can work for you as well, even if you earn a modest income and are only paying a few thousand dollars a year in state income taxes. With that in mind, lets take a look at exactly what this guide contains.</span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 120%; font-family: times; color: green; font-size: xx-large;">Here's What This Guide Offers</span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 120%; font-size: medium;">Here's how you can start taking home up to 11% more income each year.</span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 120%; font-size: medium;"> ◆ Easy To Use. I have already done the hard work to simplify and streamline this strategy into a 50 page guide. This means that you will be able to achieve maximum benefit with minimal effort.</span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 120%; font-size: medium;"> ◆ Clearly Understand What To Avoid. I show you exactly what causes you to pay up to 11% of your income as taxes. You will know exactly where the line is and what to do to avoid crossing the line that triggers tax requirements.</span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 120%; font-size: medium;"> ◆ Simple Road Map To Follow. This map shows you where you need to focus your time and effort, like showing you the shortest route between two points on a map. You will not waste time, money or energy doing things that are ineffective or irrelevant. This makes the transition for you as easy as possible.</span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 120%; font-size: medium;"> ◆ Reduce Sales Tax Too. You will be able to save significant amounts in sales and use taxes as shown to you in this guide.</span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 120%; font-size: medium;"> ◆ Warns You Of Risks. Some things are more likely to subject you to tax than others. This guide shows you exactly what those things are. Even if you live in a state with no state income tax now, you will avoid unwittingly becoming subject to income tax in other states.</span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 120%; font-size: medium;"> ◆ Easy to use checklists to streamline implementation – Implementation requires as little effort as possible by giving you this simple snapshot that acts as a to-do list and a progress chart.</span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 120%; font-size: medium;"> ◆ Case Study helps you grasp the concept. I give you a detailed, fictional case study to follow along. Each person's case will be slightly different, but following along as someone goes through the process can be of immense help to you, like watching a baseball game instead of just reading about it.</span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 120%; font-size: medium;"> ◆ Cost benefit analysis to accurately project your costs and savings. Keep the costs within control so that you take home the most money possible at the end of the day. Plus, you can more accurately for the future when you can better estimate how much you will be saving.</span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 120%; font-size: medium;"> ◆ Shows you what documents to file and how to file them – Filing these documents the right way will keep much more of your personal life private, and make your connections more expensive and difficult to audit. </span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 120%; font-size: medium;"> ◆ Minimize Audits. Taxing authorities, like any business, will usually target easier, more productive sources of revenue. This means that they are less likely to audit someone who has applied the principles of State Income Tax Optimization, and target someone who has not used State Income Tax Optimization. It makes the chances of further inquiries into your domicile, which can be expensive, vanish.</span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 120%; font-size: medium;"> ◆ This 50 page guide will save you time. I address only relevant subject matter and do so in the most concise, yet complete way possible.</span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 120%; font-size: medium;"> ◆ This guide's approach is ideal for anyone who has independent wealth and earns money from investments, ownership and is accustomed to organizing businesses and other things to maximize tax benefits. It will make you certain not to waste your income on paying taxes needlessly.</span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 120%; font-size: medium;"> ◆ This will help you turn your online wealth into truly sovereign wealth.</span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 120%; font-size: medium;"> ◆ You can be confident that the information is accurate. I have dozens of footnotes to hundreds of pages of case law, several statutes, government forms, and lots of other reference material so you or your attorney can quickly verify everything in the guide.</span><br />

<p><span style="line-height: 120%; font-size: medium;">After seeing everything you get so far, you may be asking yourself, "Where do I start? How do I know these techniques will actually work for my own state income taxes?"</span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 120%; font-size: medium;">Don't worry, I've got you covered. This special guide is specifically designed to give you a simple checklist approach to eliminating your state income taxes. I've taken all the guess work out of it for you. You get a detailed, easy-to-implement plan that will let you hit the ground running and start reducing your tax burden.</span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 120%; font-size: medium;">These techniques will work, no matter what state you are currently domiciled in. California law is the basis for the report because California has drawn some of the tightest lines in the sand around California state tax domicile. If you cross the line, you are domiciled in California. </span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 120%; font-size: medium;">Because California has drawn some of the tightest lines as any state, if you know how to avoid crossing the line in California, you will almost certainly be far from the line in almost any other state. The tools and techniques that I show you will work in any state to keep you well away from crossing the line and being domiciled where there are high state income taxes.</span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 120%; font-family: times; color: green; font-size: xx-large;">It's Easy To Get Started</span></p>

Even though the price is extremely reasonable (only a fraction of the state income taxes you pay in just one year), here's what's really important. If this program was just another philosophical argument against paying taxes that has been rejected by the courts and the taxing authorities, it wouldn't matter what the price is, it wouldn't be worth it.</span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 120%; font-size: medium;">But if you can legally reduce your state income taxes by thousands of dollars a year, protect your own income, secure your own wealth, achieve your financial goals, get more of the things that you want, spend more time with your loved ones, and do it without fear or frustration, and stay completely under the radar, what is that actually worth to you?</span></p>
