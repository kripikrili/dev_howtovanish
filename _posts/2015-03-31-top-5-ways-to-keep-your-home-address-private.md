<p>ISIS has <a href="http://thinkprogress.org/world/2015/03/23/3637539/isis-claims-hacked-military-data-servers-leaked-personnel-addresses/" target="_blank">released</a> the home address of US military personnel, soliciting attacks at their homes. Regardless of one's views on war, the idea that someone can do this is frightening. No matter what conceivably controversial views you hold, you need to know how to <a title="top 5 ways to keep your home address private" href="http://www.howtovanish.com/2015/03/top-5-ways-to-keep-your-home-address-private/" target="_blank">protect your home privacy</a> so wackos and nut jobs don't get any funny ideas. Here are the <strong>Top 5 Ways To Keep Your Home Address Private</strong>.</p>
<h2>1. Set Up A Trust</h2>
<p>If you already own property, or intend to buy, <a title="private trust" href="http://www.howtovanish.com/2011/03/address-lookup-versus-your-private-address/" target="_blank">set up a trust</a> and transfer real estate into that trust. Name the trust something unique and unconnected to you personally and name a trustee who can not be used to find you.</p>
<h2>2. New Mexico LLC</h2>
<p>Consider forming a private <a title="new mexico llc" href="https://www.myusacorporation.com/new-mexico/form-llc?ref=howtovanish" target="_blank">New Mexico LLC</a>, with no publicly listed directors, to hold your real estate if you own.</p>
<h2>3. Rent</h2>
<p><strong>Property ownership is public</strong>, r<a title="rental privacy" href="http://www.howtovanish.com/2011/03/address-lookup-versus-your-private-address/" target="_blank">ental records are not</a>. Renting directly from an owner can be more private than going through a large property management company.</p>
<h2>4. Ghost Address</h2>
<p>Use a <a title="ghost address" href="http://www.howtovanish.com/2012/05/physical-privacy-protecting-privacy-offline/" target="_blank">ghost address</a>, an address that is not your actual home address, for as many purposes as possible. Use a mail receiving business like a UPS store. List your ghost address everywhere you legally can. Use your office as a ghost address or ask a family member or friend to be your ghost address.</p>
<h2>5. Get an RV</h2>
<p>If are adventurous, live in a RV and park it in a different spot every night.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p><a title="keep address private" href="http://www.howtovanish.com/2010/04/keep-address-private/" target="_blank">Be stingy</a> with giving out your address. Don't just give out your home address when asked in an online form or on some customer rewards card application. You can give out a ghost address to most people who aren't your parole officer. <br/><br/> When a terrorist finds “your” public address, or steals data from your grocery store database or <a title="pizza delivery fail" href="http://www.howtovanish.com/2010/08/pizza-delivery-fail/" target="_blank">pizza delivery database</a>, you will be much safer if you are using these techniques.
