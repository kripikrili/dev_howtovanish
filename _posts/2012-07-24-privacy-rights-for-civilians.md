<p><strong>[pullquote]The Internet is the great equalizer of mankind.[/pullquote]</strong><a title="privacy rights for civilians" href="http://www.howtovanish.com/2012/07/privacy-rights-for-civilians" target="_blank">Privacy rights for civilians</a> seem to be in a constant state of flux. <br/><br/> The very idealism of privacy is often dependent on the formal bodies, such as the State, and can be as varied as legislation like <a title="whti" href="http://www.howtovanish.com/2009/06/how-whti-affects-you/" target="_blank">WHTI</a> or general trends like the <a title="decline of the peace officer" href="http://www.howtovanish.com/2012/07/public-anonymity-decline-peace-officer/" target="_blank">decline of the peace officer</a>. There are also those aspects of privacy maintenance on personal grounds.</p>
<p>There are areas where such legal application can be selective or limited and not applicable in various aspects. Often the State likes to protect its privacy while breaching everyone else's. There are often common themes and threads of discontent that can be seen among people with the defections of routine checkpoints. Criminal defense attorney Ivan Morse gives some helpful tips if you are stopped at a checkpoint.</p>

<p><strong>[pullquote]But the truth of the matter is that the State claims a violent monopoly on the exercise of violence and as a result the costs they charge for their services continually goes up while the quality of the services they provide declines.[/pullquote]DECEITFUL ADVERTISING</strong></p>
<p>Privacy maintenance gets hampered with over-controlled issues. Boogeymen like drugs, terrorism, etc. have scared individuals into accepting grievous infringements on their privacy. Individual safety is often trampled through experiences with the <a title="experiencing state security" href="http://www.howtovanish.com/2012/07/experiencing-the-police-state-security/" target="_blank">police state security</a> control freaks established in governmental authority bodies. All these merely illustrate the exquisite mass mania.</p>
<p>Sure, the State likes to advertise itself as providing protection, equity and justice services. But the truth of the matter is that the State claims a violent monopoly on the exercise of violence and as a result the costs they charge for their services continually goes up while the quality of the services they provide declines.<br/><br/>  Nobody would willingly pay for these State services without being coerced or forced which is why they result to such violent and nefarious tactics.</p>
<p>To think an evil institution would act any other way is simply wishful and deluded thinking and it is obvious that expansion of power and breaching of privacy to steal more resources is its core mission and not the the righteous dignity of protecting individual's privacy.</p>
<p><strong>RISE OF THE INTERNET AND FALL OF THE GATEKEEPERS</strong></p>
<p>The Internet is the great equalizer of mankind. With its rise the long established gatekeepers have been rapidly loosing their power. First, were the postal services. Second, were the news agencies as competition and other viewpoints, like How To Vanish, became possible. Third, are the copyright industries. Fourth, will be the banks and money transfer businesses with the rise of <a title="bitcoin" href="http://www.bitcoin.org" target="_blank">Bitcoin</a>.</p>

<p>The <a title="laws defining privacy protection" href="http://www.howtovanish.com/2012/06/laws-protecting-political-privacy/" target="_blank">laws defining privacy protection</a> can occasionally be invoked for temporary protection. But nobody cares about your privacy as much as you do and therefore you must take a proactive approach to controlling and protecting it.<br/><br/>  <a title="domestic security measures" href="http://www.howtovanish.com/2012/07/domestic-security-measures" target="_blank">State domestic security measures</a> will always pose a significant threat. But you can use the force multiplier of technology.</p>
<p>A ginormous amount of information gets shared daily through worldwide communications networks. Through the use of encryption you can protect your privacy as it whirls around the globe.</p>
<p><strong>CONCLUSION</strong></p>
<p>There has never been a greater period of time where privacy has been threatened. But there has never been a greater period of time where the tools available are so ubiquitous and so cheap. Truly, the Information Age is the best of times and the worst of times. The gatekeepers can be bypassed but only if you choose to.</p>
<p>ALWAYS go that extra mile to protect your personal information by implementing stealth tactics from sources like <a title="Privacy" href="http://www.howtovanish.com/products/how-to-vanish-book/">How To Vanish The Book</a> or the <a title="basic privacy guide" href="https://www.coindl.com/page/item/168" target="_blank">Basic Privacy Guide</a>.</p>
