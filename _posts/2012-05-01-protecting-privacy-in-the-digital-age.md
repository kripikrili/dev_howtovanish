<p><strong>[pullquote]An ounce of prevention is better than a pound cure.[/pullquote]</strong>People around the world are victimized every day after falling into some identity theft traps. The steep rise in the stealing of identities is something that must not be ignored. <a title="protecting privacy in the digital age" href="http://www.howtovanish.com/2012/04/protecting-privacy-in-the-digital-age/" target="_blank">Protecting privacy in the digital age</a> is getting more important.</p>
<p>In today’s Information age information is everything and it is advisable to <a title="identity protection" href="http://www.howtovanish.com/2012/03/7-effective-privacy-techniques-for-reducing-risk-of-identity-theft/">secure your private identity from identity thieves</a>. Unfortunately, just shredding or burning your bank statements and other physical effects carrying information about your identity is no longer enough to provide the necessary prevention.</p>
<p>Getting a separate legal identity, such as an <a title="llc" href="http://www.howtovanish.com/2009/08/llcs-as-a-privacy-curtain/" target="_blank">LLC</a>, along with bank accounts, a tax ID number and credit cards under that identity is one of the most plausible precautionary <a title="privacy techniques" href="http://www.howtovanish.com/2012/03/7-effective-privacy-techniques-for-reducing-risk-of-identity-theft/" target="_blank">privacy techniques</a> that you can adopt so that you are not among those 30,000 unlucky people who fall prey to identity theft by the unscrupulous.</p>
<h2>Protecting Privacy In The Digital Age</h2>
<p>The <strong>first step</strong> to protecting privacy in the digital age is getting yourself a legal business identity. We are partial to the <a title="new mexico llc asset protection attorney loves" href="http://www.howtovanish.com/2010/09/why-an-asset-protection-attorney-loves-new-mexico-llc-registration/" target="_blank">New Mexico LLC which asset protection attorneys love</a>. If you are an entrepreneur or the owner of a large asset then you must consider operating under a recognized legal entity such as corporations, LLCs and partnerships.</p>
<p>You will likely wish to seek an attorney’s advice first so that you can determine which legal entity would be the best option for your circumstances and how to best operate it. Getting a legal business entity will award you with extra privacy protection as it will put an additional layer between you and your personal information and liability from the outside world.</p>
<p>The <strong>second step</strong> is to <a title="business credit card holder" href="http://www.howtovanish.com/2010/06/protecting-identity-theft-victims-business-credit-card-holders/">secure yourself a business credit card</a>. Once you start operating as a business entity you can ask credit card companies to issue a business credit card. The good thing about these business credit cards is that you need to upload business information into the <a title="transactional databases" href="http://www.howtovanish.com/2009/11/transactional-databases-what-me-worry/" target="_blank">transactional databases</a> instead of personal details. Comparatively less harm is inflicted upon cardholders if business information is compromised as opposed to the damage caused by the leaking of personal data. Another perk is that you get to choose how your business identity appears to others with its name, a DBA (Doing Business As), etc.</p>

<h2><strong></strong>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Protecting privacy in the digital age is imperative in today’s time when information is everything and an <a title="identity theft" href="http://www.howtovanish.com/2012/03/how-to-prevent-identity-theft-and-what-to-do-if-it-happens/" target="_blank">identity theft</a> can lead to serious damage. There are many ways from using cash or a <a title="ghost address" href="http://www.runtogold.com/get-a-ghost-address/" target="_blank">ghost address</a> to using business entities and business credit cards which can increase your identity’s levels of security. One must always remember that an ounce of prevention is better than a pound cure.</p>
<p>A reason why privacy is often associated with anonymity and is a point of contention is because it squares the issue between the boundaries of the State versus the life and freedoms of the individual. But privacy and anonymity can be maintained, in general, without yielding and allowing nefarious individuals to infringe on the rights of independent citizens.</p>
