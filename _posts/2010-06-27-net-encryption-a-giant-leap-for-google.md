<p><!-- 		@page { size: 8.5in 11in; margin: 0.79in } 		P { margin-bottom: 0.08in } -->But still a small step for mankind.  Google recently began allowing users to use net encryption for basic Google searches.  What does this mean, is it worth it, is net encryption really for me, and how can you make a <a title="Net Encryption" href="http://www.howtovanish.com/2010/06/net-encryption-a-giant-leap-for-google" target="_blank">giant leap</a>.</p>
<p><strong>What in the heck is net encryption?</strong></p>
<p>Net encryption means that you are creating a secure connection between you and another computer.  If you use online financial transactions, use certain email programs, or several other things, you may already be using net encryption.  You will notice that the address bar in your browser starts with “http://”.  Whenever you enter into a secure site with net encryption you will see that an “s” is added to the end so that the web address starts “https://”.  <br /><br />There will also be a closed padlock icon in the bottom right of your browser window.  Once you are communicating through an encrypted connection, hackers and snoopers somewhere on the network between you and the destination computer won't be able to see what you are doing.</p>
<p><strong>So what is Google doing?</strong></p>
<p>They are allowing searchers to encrypt their connection to a Google server in order to run a basic Google query.  All you have to do is go to <a href="https://www.google.com/">https://www.google.com</a> and you can run an encrypted query.</p>
<p><strong>What's so neat about that?</strong></p>
<p>Your ISP will not be able to collect and catalogue what you are searching for in Google.  You may also be able to avoid the snooping eyes of network administrators like school administration or workplace restrictions on your Google searches.</p>

<p><strong>Limitations to Google's Net Encryption</strong></p>
<p>Even with this kind of net encryption, once you click through to any website, you will be exiting the secure encrypted connection.  This means that if you find a website that you want to visit with the net encryption search, you will have to find some other way to encrypt your visit to that site.  Other anonymous web surfing tools do not break the chain of anonymity when you click through to a website. <br /><br /> Another downside is that Google will still have a record of your web search because you are encrypting your connection to them.  That is a bit like a Jim Carey in the <a href="http://www.howtovanish.com/TrumanShowBluRay">Truman Show</a> being completely alone with nothing but the cameras secretly watching him.</p>
<p>Google warns about some other limitations like possibly slower internet service.  This may be true, and I have only used it sporadically to test it out, but I did not notice any appreciable slowing from using the services.</p>
<p><strong>Is it for Me?</strong></p>
<p>Just because there are limitations doesn't mean you shouldn't use it. It is a neat little tool which may fit your needs perfectly. For others, it may just be a smaller tool in an overall strategy of privacy protection.  For example, if you borrow someone else's computer for a few minutes and you don't want the record of the search to be easily linked to them by their ISP.</p>
<p><strong>A Bigger Step For You</strong></p>
<p>Since Google still collects the data from your encrypted search, you can use other anonymizing searches like  <a title="Startpage" href="http://startpage.com/" target="_blank">Startpage</a>.  Startpage does not save any identifying information after a search is complete.  You will still lose your anonymity once you click through to a website.  <br /><br />Another more powerful tool, yet still somewhat limited is the <a title="Net Encryption" href="https://www.eff.org/https-everywhere" target="_blank">HTTPS Everywhere</a> plugin.  <a href="http://www.howtovanish.com/IdentityCloaker">Anonymous web surfing</a> through proxies allows you to remain anonymous during Google searches and when you click through to a website.  That <a title="anonymous browsing" href="http://www.howtovanish.com/2009/11/should-i-pay-for-anonymous-web-surfing/" target="_blank">anonymous browsing</a> is a much <a title="Moon Landing" href="http://www.howtovanish.com/Moon" target="_blank">bigger step for mankind</a>.</p>
