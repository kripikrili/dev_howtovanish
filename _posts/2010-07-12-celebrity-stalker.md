<p><!-- 		@page { size: 8.5in 11in; margin: 0.79in } 		P { margin-bottom: 0.08in } -->You think your work is crazy?  I have a good friend who is a psychologist and her work literally is crazy.  She deals with people who are not only mentally disturbed but a lot of them are dangerous too. She has to be very careful that one of her patients doesn't find out where she lives.</p>
<p>Hot celebrities are always at risk of a celebrity stalker showing up at their house.  A hot psychologist has almost the same level of risk.  Unlike <a title="ivanka" href="http://www.nydailynews.com/gossip/2010/04/02/2010-04-02_ivanka_stalk_susp_ill_kill_myself_in_her_jewelry_shop.html" target="_blank">Ivanka Trump</a>, this hot psychologists doesn't  have a team of personal bodyguards protecting her from celebrity stalkers at all times.  There are only women at her house and she is feisty but petite.  Most people don't have the same risk level as Ivanka or my friend, but  I'm sure everyone knows someone who is vulnerable at home.</p>
<p>Fortunately, lawyers have magical powers to solve all kinds of problems.  Double fortunately, I use my powers for good.  Here are the most important things I have told my friend to do to reduce the risk from deranged fans.</p>
<p><strong>Avoid Celebrity Stalkers By Being Hard To Look Up</strong></p>
<p>Unlist your address and phone number from the phone book and other online and offline directories.  This is always the first place stalkers will look.  This includes keeping your social networking sites clean of anything that hints at addresses or phone numbers.</p>
<p>Rent your home or buy your residence using a trust or <a href="http://www.billroundsjd.com">LLC</a>.  Remember not to name the trust or LLC anything that would identify you.</p>
<p>Don't get utilities in your name.  Use the name of a willing friend or in the name of a trust or LLC.</p>
<p>Don't have any mail sent to your house in your name.  Send mail to a PO box or another <a title="ghost address" href="http://www.runtogold.com/get-a-ghost-address/" target="_blank">ghost address</a>.  If you do receive mail at home, make sure everything is addressed to your LLC.   The same is true for FedEx, UPS and other couriers.  Use a ghost address for all billing addresses.</p>
<p><strong>Avoid Being Followed Home By Celebrity Stalkers</strong></p>
<p>My friend works in an institutional setting where there are security guards and other staff members. At work she is relatively safe.  She needs to take the most care when she is leaving work or any time she is out and about.</p>
<p>Situational Awareness – When going to your car, be aware of any people hanging around in the parking lot, any suspicious vehicles, vehicles with people waiting in them, or any cars that follow you out of the parking lot.  One way to help throw anybody off the trail is to try and leave at a different time every day.</p>
<p>Take a different route home every day.  Someone might be able to map your route home without overtly following you.  They just watch you drive down the street for long as they can see you, then move to the point that you vanished the next day and repeat.   If you take a different route home every day,  it can be very difficult to reconstruct your map without following you.</p>
<p>If you do notice someone following you, do not keep going home.  Turn and go in the exact opposite direction.  Stop somewhere where you know people will be or go to a friends house who used to be a USC linebacker.  You can also make <a title="Executive Protection Training" href="http://www.howtovanish.com/2010/03/executive-protection-training-5-easy-tips/" target="_blank">executive protection training</a> moves, like taking a racing corner, to increase your distance between you and your follower.</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>These are just a few of the things that anyone in my friend's situation can do to protect themselves from being harassed by celebrity stalkers, patients, or raving fans.</p>
