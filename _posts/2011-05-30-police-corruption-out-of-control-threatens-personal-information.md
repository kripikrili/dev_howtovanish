title: 'Police Corruption Out Of Control: Threatens Personal Information'
published: true
---
<p>The San Diego Police Department has finally done it! They get their shot at having the <a title="Police Corruption" href="http://www.howtovanish.com/2011/05/police-corruption-out-of-control-threatens-personal-information/" target="_blank">highest incarceration rate in the world</a>. But not among the residents of San Diego, among the ranks of the SDPD itself.</p>
<h2>Police Corruption Means High Percentage Of Police Are Criminals</h2>
<p>The<a href="http://www.voiceofsandiego.org/data-drive/article_02f549a8-889c-11e0-81ed-001cc4c002e0.html" target="_blank"> SDPD currently has 11 officers</a> out of <a href="http://www.sdblue.net/" target="_blank">1,100 patrol officers</a> under criminal or internal investigation.<br/><br/> The alleged police corruption ranges from drunk driving and harassment, all the way to domestic violence, sexual assault and rape. That is a solid 1% of the police. If they play their cards right and all 11 get locked up, the SDPD will have about the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incarceration_in_the_United_States" target="_blank">same incarceration rate as the general US population</a>! That gives the SDPD a solid chance to take sole possession of first place very soon.</p>

<h2>SDPD - Higher Percentage Of Criminals Than Any Other Population In The World</h2>
<p>Having a higher incarceration rate than the general US population  is quite an accomplishment. But, given the fact that the US has the highest incarceration rate in the world, the SDPD has a solid chance of taking sole possession of first place very soon.<br/><br/> The closest competitor is <a href="http://www.nccd-crc.org/nccd/pubs/2006nov_factsheet_incarceration.pdf" target="_blank">Russia with a .6% rate</a>, a mark that the SDPD are very likely to beat, even if all the criminal officers aren't incarcerated.</p>
<h2>Personal Information Available To Criminal Police Officers</h2>
<p>So what are innocent people to do when the boys in blue are just as likely to be a criminal as anyone else off the street. Is your information really protected when access is limited to law enforcement riddled with police corruption? Your internet activity, phone records, phone location, bank records and lots of other information are searchable by law enforcement. <br/><br/>And what about the information that you are required to give law enforcement, like your name, address, drivers license, etc.?</p>
<p><a href="http://www.howtovanish.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/swat.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-2753" title="Police Corruption 2" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/swat-300x220.jpg" alt="Police Corruption" width="300" height="220" /></a></p>
<h2>Protect Personal Information From Police Corruption</h2>
<p>There are lots of ways to limit or protect your information from falling into criminal hands, no matter what uniform they are wearing. <a title="anonymous web surfing" href="http://www.howtovanish.com/2009/08/anonymous-web-surfing/" target="_blank">Proxy servers or VPNs</a> based <a href="http://www.howtovanish.com/IdentityCloaker">in another country</a> keep your internet searches out of the jurisdiction of domestic authorities. VoIP phone services based in a foreign country can minimize the phone records available to law enforcement without a warrant. <br/><br/><a title="cell phone security" href="http://www.howtovanish.com/2010/01/cell-phone-security-mobile-phone-taps/" target="_blank">Removing the battery of your cell phone</a> keeps your location from being tracked. You could also bank in a foreign jurisdiction to increase the costs to law enforcement of searching your bank records. You could even go so far as getting a <a title="foreign drivers license" href="http://www.howtovanish.com/2011/05/foreign-drivers-license-protects-families/" target="_blank">foreign drivers license</a> so that you reveal less of your sensitive information, like <a title="keep your home address to yourself" href="http://www.howtovanish.com/2010/04/keep-address-private/" target="_blank">the address where you stay in the US</a>, to the 1% of the police officers that are criminals.</p>
<h2>Record Police Corruption Without Violating The Law</h2>
<p>It is also important to note how modest the record breaking police are about having their picture taken by admiring fans. Sometimes amateur camera men are <a href="http://gizmodo.com/5553765/are-cameras-the-new-guns" target="_blank">arrested and charged with a crime</a>, usually for recording a cop without their consent under wire tapping laws.<a href="http://www.copblock.org/" target="_blank"> CopBlock.org</a> is <a title="Cop Block" href="http://www.copblock.org/4826/nine-incidents-added-to-war-on-cameras-map/" target="_blank">full of these kinds of encounters</a>.  Getting charged with a crime has a huge affect on your personal privacy.</p>
<p>A few states require you to get consent from everyone involved before you can record a conversation. Through some extreme distortions of <a href="http://www.ncsl.org/default.aspx?tabid=13492" target="_blank">these wire tapping laws</a>, and with the help of prosecutors and judges who possibly aid and abet police misconduct, prosecutions for filming cops are possible, although relatively rare.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.howtovanish.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Fat-Cop-Fat_500x500.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-2754" title="Police Corruption 3" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/Fat-Cop-Fat_500x500-208x300.jpg" alt="Police Corruption" width="208" height="300" /></a></p>
<p>It cannot be helped that some people, like Rosa Parks, will violate unjust laws in protest.  Others who do not want to risk prosecution can avoid breaking the law and still contribute to protecting liberty.</p>
<h2>Don't Record Sound When Recording Police</h2>
<p>To help prevent violation of a grossly distorted understanding of wire tapping laws, don't forget to take your special Cop Cam that does not record sound. Since most wire tapping statutes require you to record a conversation to violate the law, if you don't record the sounds of a conversation, you probably won't be guilty of a crime. The individual facts of each situation will be important for your attorney before they can give you legal advice on the matter.</p>

Using these tips, and others in the book <a href="http://www.howtovanish.com/htvbookaddtocart">How To Vanish</a>, you can legally prevent the police from gathering more information than you are legally required to provide. And you can prevent violating any laws when you are trying to contribute to helping the police set a record for the number of criminals in their ranks.</p>
