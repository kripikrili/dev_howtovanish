<p>Since you need a computer and the internet to get to HowToVanish.com, I thought I would give you some better privacy resources as far as privacy software to protect your computer, your internet use, and the transfer of data over the interwebs.  I have put it in a new section of the website to act as a privacy center for <a title="privacy software" href="http://www.howtovanish.com/privacy-tools-and-resources/privacy-software/" target="_blank">Privacy Software</a> under the <a title="privacy tools and resources" href="http://www.howtovanish.com/privacy-tools-and-resources/" target="_blank">Privacy Tools and Resources</a> tab so you can refer back to it in the future.  Hopefully this will help a lot of people take important steps to protecting their digital privacy.</p>
<p>Go check it out. <a title="privacy software" href="http://www.howtovanish.com/privacy-tools-and-resources/privacy-software/" target="_blank">Privacy Software</a></p>
