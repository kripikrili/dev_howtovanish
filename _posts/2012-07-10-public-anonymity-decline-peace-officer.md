<p><a title="public anonymity" href="http://www.howtovanish.com/2012/07/public-anonymity-decline-peace-officer" target="_blank">Public anonymity</a> is extremely important for personal safety, protection from <a title="identity theft" href="http://www.howtovanish.com/2012/03/7-effective-privacy-techniques-for-reducing-risk-of-identity-theft/" target="_blank">identity theft</a> and as a preventative measure from being targeted by nefarious criminals. Many advanced advanced nations have been facing the tension between disclosure and public anonymity while receiving many complaints from the people.</p>
<p>For some, this can be become a plague leading to a real time call for a pattern of paranoia. But does potentially catching a single bank robber really justify stopping 19 cars full of innocent people and handcuffing everyone at gunpoint?</p>
<p>That is <a title="massive police handcuffing" href="http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/headlines/2012/06/police-stop-handcuff-every-adult-at-intersection-in-search-for-bank-robber/" target="_blank">what happened in Aurora, Colorado</a> on 4 June 2012. What if Officer Trigger Happy of the Aurora Police Department gets a little jumpy and blows away an innocent teenager? Who are the real terrorists?</p>

<p><strong>POLICE STATE AND AGENT PROVOCATEURS</strong></p>
<p>This may not be the case in every place or area. But the alarming calls regarding the <a title="police state" href="http://www.howtovanish.com/2012/07/experiencing-the-police-state-security/" target="_blank">police state</a> have been increasing and big issues have been missed.</p>
<p>Connection to the relative fields of understanding how overall privacy maintenance is seen in most western countries now can be quite a detour from universal qualities regarding notions of brotherhood, equal rights, freedom and <a title="american privacy rights" href="http://www.howtovanish.com/2012/05/privacy-rights-for-americans/">privacy rights</a>. The upper hand factors usually go to the <a title="state security measures" href="http://www.howtovanish.com/2011/08/ignore-the-police/" target="_blank">state security measures</a> and bodies while consistently reducing individual rights and privacy.</p>
<p>In places like airports, bus stations, hospitals, schools and many other public places it seems <a title="agent provocateur" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agent_provocateur" target="_blank">agent provocateurs</a>, like those in <a title="canada police agent provocateur" href="http://www.thestar.com/News/article/248608" target="_blank">Canada wearing identical boots as the local police</a>, have been used to create shocks and mayhem which are later used as reasons to protect the oppressed by relentlessly invading private lives, personal activities and infringing on unalienable freedoms. There are some small things you can do to protect yourself from these gangsters.</p>

<p><strong>DECLINE AND FALL OF PEACE OFFICERS</strong></p>
<p>Maintaining peace, protection, love, and order is in everyone's best interest but so is privacy, autonomy and being left alone. If public protection law keeps barging into the private realms without any real or solidly rooted theory then in practice we will all be the worse off.</p>
<p>The instances of being bullied by the local costumed criminal gangs is now out in the open or for all to see and for the sake of legitimate law enforcement the current franchises should take heed before they completely lose the confidence of their protectorates. After all, the friendly neighborhood <em>peace</em> officer Andy Griffith died 3 July 2012.</p>

<p>Many nations are gripped in financial and economic crisis. As a result, they have resorted to the only method they know: <em>violence</em>. This increased harshness and jarring tones from public law enforcement officials is having the opposite effect. People are losing faith, confidence and trust in the public institutions and seeing them for the violent enterprises they are.</p>
<p>No longer are they viewed as institutions to be honored or reverenced but instead as busybody administrive bodies hellbent on violently oppressing and stealing from <a title="mohammad bouazizi" href="http://articles.cnn.com/2011-03-22/world/tunisia.bouazizi.arab.unrest_1_fruit-vendor-sidi-bouzid-abedine-ben-ali?_s=PM:WORLD" target="_blank">Mohammad Bouazizi</a>, the guy who just wants to sell some fruit to feed his family. with discernment from the authorship of administrative bodies.</p>
<p>Hopefully, you now have a better look the need for public anonymity and how it can help you to take control of and protect your financial privacy. And remember: ALWAYS go that extra mile to protect your personal information by implementing stealth tactics from sources like <a title="how to vanish the book" href="http://www.howtovanish.com/products/how-to-vanish-book/" target="_blank">How To Vanish The Book</a> or the <a title="howtovanish bitcoin store" href="https://www.coindl.com/page/author/61" target="_blank">Free Privacy Guide</a>.</p>
