Here are eight very simple <a title="privacy tips" href="http://www.howtovanish.com/2012/03/10-privacy-tips-for-protecting-your-identity-and-avoiding-identity-theft/" target="_blank">privacy tips</a> that will help you protect your identity and hard earned money.</p>
<p><strong>1.</strong> The most basic step to <a title="prevent identity theft" href="http://www.howtovanish.com/2012/03/7-effective-privacy-techniques-for-reducing-risk-of-identity-theft/">prevent identity theft</a> is to regularly monitor your credit card and bank statements.<br/><br/>  Many thieves begin by making small purchases so it advisable to always keep receipts from your purchases and review the expenses with your statements. Additionally, <a title="credit karma" href="http://www.creditkarma.com" target="_blank">Credit Karma</a> provides free credit scores and reports.</p>
<p><strong>2.</strong> Do not reveal personal information to unreliable sources. If you get a call from someone purporting to be with a well known company inquiring after your personal information and account number then do not reveal it without verifying the legitimacy of the individual asking.<br/><br/>  Many legitimate companies never follow this procedure to get information. For example, you can ask for a phone number to call back and verify that phone number on the company's official website.</p>
<p><strong>3.</strong> Governments have massively screwed up the whole identity process by issuing social security numbers which make identity theft much easier. Protect your social security number from getting in the hands of such thieves. For this you must never leave home with it unless there is a genuine need.</p>
<p>If you have to give your social security number in hospitals or while filling out a job application then care must be taken that the numbers are stored in safe place.<br/><br/>  You can ask what their privacy policies are to protect the number. While we do not recommend it; some people have inadvertently or accidentally juxtaposed a digit on the form.</p>
