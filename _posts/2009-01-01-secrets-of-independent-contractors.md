<td style="text-align: left;"><a href="http://www.howtovanish.com/products/secrets-of-independent-contractors/" target="_blank">Secrets of Independent Contractors</a> â€“ Both workers and business owners can reduce the taxes that they pay by using this extremely simple tax strategy. It not only gives people more control over their money, but lets them keep more of it. Even the Wall Street Journal has outlined how someone who is an independent contractor can earn $150,000 of income in a year and owe $0 in income taxes by taking only a handful of commonplace deductions and credits. Plus, business owners can reduce the risk of litigation, increase worker productivity, and reduce overall labor costs, at the same time. It is a win-win for both sides of the coin, workers and businesses. It can also be the critical foundation for being able to use State Income Optimization, an even more powerful and more profitable tax strategy.</td>
