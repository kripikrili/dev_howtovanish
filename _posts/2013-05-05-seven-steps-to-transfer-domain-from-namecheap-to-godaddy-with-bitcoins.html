<p>GoDaddy spams you with worthless offers on checkout. And do not even offer a discount. Then they support SOPA and PIPA to infringe on our Internet freedom. Those bastards!</p>
<p>Meanwhile <a title="namecheap" href="http://www.howtovanish.com/namecheap" target="_blank">Namecheap</a> donates over $100,000 to the <a title="electronic frontier foundation" href="https://www.eff.org/" target="_blank">Electronic Frontier Foundation</a> to protect our digital rights and Internet freedom. And now like most <a title="liberty proponents accept bitcoin" href="http://www.howtovanish.com/2012/09/why-bitcoin-acceptance-should-be-a-bellweather-of-liberty-proponents/" target="_blank">sane liberty proponents Namecheap accepts Bitcoin for payment</a>. Plus, they are <strong>10-30% cheaper</strong>!</p>
<p>In these seven easy steps I will show you how to exercise your most powerful vote by using your money to <a title="transfer domains from godaddy to namecheap" href="http://www.howtovanish.com/2013/05/seven-steps-to-transfer-domain-from-namecheap-to-godaddy-with-bitcoins/" target="_blank">transfer your domains from Godaddy</a>, or really any registrar for that matter, to the honorable <a title="namecheap" href="http://www.howtovanish.com/namecheap" target="_blank">Namecheap</a>.</p>
<p>By doing so you will <strong>(1)</strong> increase your privacy by paying with bitcoins and getting free WhoisGuard protection, <strong>(2)</strong> not get spammed on checkout during renewal by Godaddy's time wasting tactics, <strong>(3)</strong> support a company that helps protect our Internet freedom, <strong>(4)</strong> remove financial support from a nasty company that supported the nefarious SOPA and PIPA bills and <strong>(5)</strong> have the entire transfer completed in about 30 minutes to two hours, the longest part are the Bitcoin confirmations, instead of the normal 3-5 days.</p>
<p><strong>STEP ONE</strong></p>
<p>The first step will be to add funds to your <a title="namecheap" href="http://www.howtovanish.com/namecheap" target="_blank">Namecheap</a> account using Bitcoins. Even though they use <a title="bitpay" href="http://www.bitpay.com" target="_blank">Bitpay</a>, who is a superb Bitcoin payment processor, this is still the longest part of the seven steps since it may require waiting for confirmations from the Bitcoin network so be sure to include a transaction fee. Or you can preload your account using Bitcoin and then skip this step entirely each time you go to renew or transfer a domain.</p>
<p>Unfamiliar with Bitcoin? It is a decentralized peer-to-peer currency that is pseudo-anonymous. That means your identity is not tied to it like with a credit card or Paypal account. This helps protect your privacy when you register domain names and in case your domain registrar account is compromised then your credit card details are not available to be stolen. If you want to learn how to use Bitcoin then we suggest getting a copy of our <a title="free bitcoin guide" href="http://www.freebitcoinguide.com" target="_blank">Free Bitcoin Guide</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" alt="namecheap bitcoins" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/namecheap-bitcoins.jpg" width="520" height="232" /></p>
<p><strong>STEP TWO</strong></p>
<p>You will need to make sure the domain you want to transfer from Godaddy is unlocked. Then you will need to request the EPP code.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" alt="godaddy unlock domain epp code" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/godaddy-unlock-domain-epp-code.jpg" width="520" height="112" /></p>
<p>If you need to unlock the domain or get the EPP code then just click on the domain from the domain manager. Here you can easily modify the settings and request the EPP code.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" alt="godaddy unlock epp code settings" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/godaddy-unlock-epp-code-settings.jpg" width="520" height="170" /></p>
<p><strong>STEP THREE</strong></p>
<p>You will need to initiate the transfer with <a title="namecheap" href="http://www.howtovanish.com/namecheap" target="_blank">Namecheap</a>. To protect your privacy, reduce your chance of identity theft and support Internet freedom we recommend you pay using bitcoins.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" alt="namecheap transfer domain" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/namecheap-transfer-domain.jpg" width="520" height="150" /></p>
<p><a title="namecheap" href="http://www.howtovanish.com/namecheap" target="_blank">Namecheap</a> will request an EPP code from you that you will need from Godaddy and should have requested in step two.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" alt="namecheap submit epp code" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/namecheap-submit-epp-code.jpg" width="520" height="74" /></p>
<p><strong>STEP FOUR</strong></p>
<p>Next you will need to check your email for the EPP code from Godaddy.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" alt="godaddy epp code" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/godaddy-epp-code.jpg" width="265" height="146" /></p>
<p>Then you will need to submit the EPP code to <a title="namecheap" href="http://www.howtovanish.com/namecheap" target="_blank">Namecheap</a> using either the link provided in the email or by clicking on the domain in the Domain Transfer Status area of your account.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" alt="namecheap submit epp code" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/namecheap-submit-epp-code.jpg" width="520" height="74" /></p>
<p><strong>STEP FIVE</strong></p>
<p>You will be sent an email from <a title="namecheap" href="http://www.howtovanish.com/namecheap" target="_blank">Namecheap</a> indicating you need to accept the transfer.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" alt="namecheap accept domain transfer" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/namecheap-accept-domain-transfer.jpg" width="520" height="108" /></p>
<p>So click on the link and accept the transfer.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" alt="namecheap accept domain transfer email" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/namecheap-accept-domain-transfer-email.jpg" width="520" height="126" /></p>
<p>If you failed to unlock the domain then redo step two and resubmit the transfer request in your <a title="namecheap" href="http://www.howtovanish.com/namecheap" target="_blank">Namecheap</a> account.</p>
<p><strong>STEP SIX</strong></p>
<p>Now Godaddy will send you a domain transfer request.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" alt="godaddy accept domain transfer request" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/godaddy-accept-transfer-request.jpg" width="466" height="193" /></p>
<p>So you will need to accept the transfer in your Godaddy Domain Manager area.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" alt="godaddy domain transfer accept decline" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/godaddy-transfer-accept-decline.jpg" width="520" height="125" /></p>
<p><strong></strong><strong>STEP SEVEN</strong></p>
<p>Within about five to thirty minutes the domain should appear in your <a title="namecheap" href="http://www.howtovanish.com/namecheap" target="_blank">Namecheap</a> account. In the meantime, you can monitor the status of the transfer in there.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" alt="namecheap domain transfer status" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/namecheap-domain-transfer-status.jpg" width="520" height="195" /></p>
<p>You will want to verify that the domain got completely transferred.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" alt="godaddy namecheap domain transfer complete" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/godaddy-namecheap-domain-transfer-complete.jpg" width="520" height="100" /></p>
<p><strong>CONCLUSION</strong></p>
<p>So hopefully you are now happy with your domains safely with the honorable domain registrar <a title="namecheap" href="http://www.howtovanish.com/namecheap" target="_blank">Namecheap</a> that respects your time, attention and Internet freedom. And you got to use your bitcoins for something important and productive!</p>
