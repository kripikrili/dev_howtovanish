<p>Do you sometimes feel that there is a <a title="Need For Privacy And Data Protection" href="http://www.howtovanish.com/2012/06/need-for-privacy-and-data-protection" target="_blank">need for privacy and data protection</a>? Well its time you take a closer look at the scenario of depleting privacy to form an educated conclusion.</p>
<p>It is true that technology has begun keeping track of all our moves and at most times we are unaware of this invasive technology’s prying eyes.  You movements are tracked with a cell phone, your purchases via credit and debit cards are tracked, archived, databased and searchable while being linked to your identity and in many cases your home address is a matter of public record.</p>
<p><strong>FREE PRIVACY TOOLS</strong></p>
<p>But one must not forget how technology has also made it extremely easy for us to protect our private information. There are free and easy to use tools such as TOR, <a title="truecrypt" href="http://www.howtovanish.com/2010/11/how-to-use-dropbox-truecrypt-transfer-files/" target="_blank">Truecrypt</a>, GnuPGP, <a title="mailinator" href="http://www.mailinator.com" target="_blank">Mailinator</a> and others that can help keep your privacy protected.<br/><br/>  So, even if technological efforts are being made to breach your privacy you must not lose heart because there also being developed personal privacy protecting solutions with more being introduced with every day.</p>

<p>Privacy-protecting technologies are much easier to employ as opposed to privacy invading techniques. It only takes a couple of seconds to encrypt confidential files or e-mails whereas it would require a good deal of technical skill, time and money to break into them. You can leverage this to your advantage.</p>
<p>Apart from technology there are some ridiculous social norms that force people to participate in social network surveillance that also results in unwanted breach of private space. Government and advertisers have more claims to our personal information than many would prefer and the rising popularity of the many social networking sites has resulted on direct privacy attacks.</p>
<p>A law such as the Patriot Law also threatens the <a title="privacy rights for americans" href="http://www.howtovanish.com/2012/05/privacy-rights-for-americans">privacy rights for Americans</a>. This law vests the power of constant warrantless wiretaps, digital searches and bank account intrusions that are now under unreliable government surveillance. Even telecommunications are manned by strict regulations which prohibit some communication without government permission.</p>

<p><strong>ENCRYPTION</strong></p>
<p>A powerful stance in favor of protecting privacy and data is to master the skills of using strong encryption. This has become an easy skill to master because of its widespread need during these bleak times when our information is so unguarded. Powerful encryption was first introduced thousands of years ago with ciphers. <br/><br/> In recent times, the United States made it illegal to export encryption technologies to other countries fearing that it might fall in the hands of enemies. However, this law against exportation of encryption was repealed.</p>
<p>[HTML3]</p>
<p>Now everyone can use encryption to protect his or her sensitive files because it is free and easy! Torrents, Tor, GnuPGP and BitCoin make it possible for individuals to communicate privately and engage in financial transactions while being thousands of miles away <a title="obtain financial privacy by using bitcoin" href="http://www.howtovanish.com/2012/04/bitcoin-how-to-obtain-financial-privacy/">by using Bitcoin</a> so you will not have any international limitations to your business assuming such technologies are legal in the nations you are operating in.</p>

<p><strong>CONCLUSION</strong></p>
<p>Therefore we can hereby conclude that <a title="is privacy dead" href="http://www.howtovanish.com/2011/12/is-privacy-dead/">privacy is not dead</a>. Yes, it is certainly endangered but we can always increase the levels of security provided by such powerful tools the world has never seen before and take proactive steps to protect our privacy. <br/><br/> We can save ourselves from unwanted breaches of our sacred private space by investing small efforts into its protection and also by being careful.</p>
<p>There will always be threats to our privacy but we can rest assured that many solutions will also come about to help protection us. For now we just have to create some private areas where we can store our confidential files and carry on anonymous communication and financial transactions.</p>
<p>Hopefully, you now have an idea of the need for privacy and data protection and how it can help you to take control of and protect your financial privacy. <br/><br/> And remember: ALWAYS go that extra mile to protect your personal information by implementing stealth tactics from sources like <a title="Privacy" href="http://www.howtovanish.com/products/how-to-vanish-book/">How To Vanish The Book</a> or <a title="beginner's guide to bitcoin and bitcoin services" href="https://www.coindl.com/page/item/242" target="_blank">The Beginner's Guide To BitCoin And BitCoin Services</a>.</p>
