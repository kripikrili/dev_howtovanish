<p>The <a href="https://firstlook.org/theintercept/2014/05/19/data-pirates-caribbean-nsa-recording-every-cell-phone-call-bahamas/" target="_blank">NSA records cell phone calls</a>, saves them and searches them. According to Glenn Greenwald, the <a href="http://www.computerworld.com/article/2473898/data-privacy/nsa-collected-1-trillion-metadata-records--harvested-1-billion-mobile-calls-daily.html" target="_blank">NSA can collect over 1 billion phone calls per day</a>.  The <a href="http://firstamendmentcoalition.org/2013/02/lapds-use-of-stingray-cell-phone-monitoring-tool-revealed-by-fac-public-records-request/" target="_blank">LAPD has been caught using a Stingray device</a> which can <a href="http://www.howtovanish.com/2015/01/tin-foil-hat-for-your-phone/" target="_blank">track cell phones</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellphone_surveillance" target="_blank">record unencrypted  mobile phone calls</a>. There are at least 3 ways to make your mobile phone <a href="http://www.howtovanish.com/2015/02/nsa-proof-mobile-phone-call-encryption" target="_blank">NSA proof and encrypt your mobile phone calls</a>.</p>
<h2>1. Encryption Apps</h2>
<p>There are <a href="http://www.howtovanish.com/2011/06/cell-phone-security/" target="_blank">applications</a> that can be downloaded on most mobile phones that will encrypt mobile phone calls. iPhone users can get <a href="https://whispersystems.org/blog/signal/" target="_blank">Signal</a> and Android users can get <a href="https://whispersystems.org/#privacy" target="_blank">RedPhone</a>. Both are from WhisperSystems, both are free and open source and both do a good job at protecting the privacy of your mobile phone calls. <a href="https://silentcircle.com/services" target="_blank">Silent Circle</a> also has an app which can be downloaded for any phone. There is a fee for Silent Circle but you can probably expect better user support for the fee.</p>
<h2>2. Encrypted Mobile Phone</h2>
<p>The biggest risk to your privacy is probably your smart phone.  <a href="https://blackphone.ch/" target="_blank">Blackphone</a> is a mobile phone purposely built for privacy. Instead of upgrading to the new iPhone or Android based maker, consider Blackphone. For the tech geek, a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_open-source_mobile_phones" target="_blank">Linux based cell phone</a> offers user control over encryption of the phone and all calls.</p>
<h2>3. Hardware Add-ons</h2>
<p>There are some promising ideas in development right now that could contribute to the privacy of mobile phone calls. <a href="CryptoCom.pw" target="_blank">Safewire</a> is an external audio/mic that is designed to plug into your mobile phone and encrypt your voice before reaching the NSA controlled cell phone network.</p>
<p>Check out these, and more ways to encrypt mobile phone calls and keep the NSA, LAPD and others, out of your mobile phone calls.  Read more at <a href="http://www.howtovanish.com/" target="_blank">HowToVanish.com</a> or check out the <a href="http://www.howtovanish.com/products/how-to-vanish-book/" target="_blank">book How To Vanish</a>.</p>
