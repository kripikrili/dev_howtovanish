<p>When most people browse the Internet they are not aware of the risks involved. You may not be aware of the kind of information you are leaving behind when you visit certain sites.

<p>This is because your Internet privacy is not protected against people who are seeking to misuse all the information lying around in your computer. Learn <a title="how to protect internet privacy" href="http://www.howtovanish.com/2012/04/how-to-protect-internet-privacy">how to protect Internet privacy</a> and at the same time browse the web safely.</p>
<h2>How To Protect Internet Privacy</h2>
<p>The best utility for this is proxy servers make that your IP address a complete secret. This can be extremely useful because this important information, your IP address, is not shared with anyone else. You can easily choose the kind of proxy which suits you best because some may not allow you to log into sites like Facebook while others may be painfully slow.</p>
<p>It is very easy to use a proxy server so I recommend you try out <a title="Identity Cloaker" href="http://www.identitycloaker.com/?a_aid=how2vanish_idcloaker&amp;a_bid=2" target="_blank">Identity Cloaker</a> which many people have found very useful. Typically, your cost can go all the way up to $100 per month depending upon the speed and accuracy with which the server works.</p>

<p>You can even download free software or paid software which will ensure privacy when it comes to browsing the Internet. It can be easily activated while you are using the Internet in order to block your IP address from being utilized by a third party. <br/><br/> It is likely that you may initially find it problematic to configure this software especially if you are using an unpaid version. One great free Firefox plugin is <a title="adblock plus" href="http://adblockplus.org/en/" target="_blank">Adblock Plus</a>.</p>
<p>Obviously, a paid version is likely to be more useful because hopefully you can access excellent customer support options. In case of any problems you will be guided on how to set up the software so that your Internet protection is enabled. <br/><br/> The paid software may be more efficient and work really fast. Unless some expert hacker is out to get the IP address of your system then your information is likely to stay protected and safe.</p>
<p>Make sure that a good anti-virus properly protects your computer. Anti-viruses are important because they keep your computers well protected from Trojans and viruses, which might get hold of your personal information from your computer data.</p>
