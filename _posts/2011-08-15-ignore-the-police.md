title: Ignore The Police!

<p>For the past few months, police departments have been using a new<a href="http://www.bi2technologies.com/" target="_blank"> iris scanning device</a> to identify people they encounter.  Many more police departments will begin using this device soon. <br/><br/>The scanner can be held up to the eye of any person and almost<a href="http://www.howtovanish.com/2011/08/ignore-the-police/" target="_blank"> instantly identify</a> them more accurately than a fingerprint.  Police have imposed restrictions on themselves to prevent misuse of iris scanners.  Like a chubby kid guarding a Happy Meal, indulgence is more likely than restraint.</p>

<p>Currently, iris scanners are limited to checking the person scanned against a national database of iris scans.  This database presumably only contains criminals, children and individuals who may need assistance, like alzheimers patients.  <br/><br/>The devices are not supposed to be able to capture and store new entries.  These self-imposed limitations may only be temporary.</p>
<h2>Warrantless Iris Scans Are Probably Unconstitutional</h2>
<p>Although not yet tested, there are some potentially strong constitutional challenges to many iris scans that are likely to occur.  If you have a reasonable expectation of privacy in some information or item, the police need a warrant to conduct a search.  (<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/historics/USSC_CR_0389_0347_ZO.html" target="_blank">Katz v. United States</a>) There is no reasonable expectation of privacy for things that are in the plain view of the public.  (<a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=9458625535110498158&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2&amp;as_vis=1&amp;oi=scholarr" target="_blank">Texas v. Brown</a>)  Technologies that enhance the senses to be able to see what is in plain view, like common binoculars, can be used by police without a warrant.  (<a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=2807189437219807369&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2&amp;as_vis=1&amp;oi=scholarr" target="_blank">Dow Chemical v. United States</a>) Something that is not visible to the naked eye is not in plain view.  (<a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=13894501388713609672&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2&amp;as_vis=1&amp;oi=scholarr" target="_blank">California v. Ciraolo</a>; <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/99-8508.ZO.html" target="_blank">Kyllo v. United States</a>; <a href="http://jweinsteinlaw.com/pdfs/People%20v_%20Arno%20%281979%29%2090%20CA3d%20505.htm" target="_blank">People v. Arno</a>)  Police may also conduct a search that would otherwise require a warrant if they get consent. <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=4378189236447054894&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2&amp;as_vis=1&amp;oi=scholarr" target="_blank">(Schneckloth v. Bustamonte</a>).<a href="http://www.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?navby=case&amp;court=us&amp;vol=412&amp;invol=218"><br />
</a></p>
<p>An image of your iris and the detail of your iris is apparently very important information.  Many people might reasonably expect to have a right to privacy in that intimate part of their body.  <br/><br/>Although the iris is held out to the public, the very intimate details, so much detail that the iris becomes a unique identifier, is not held out to the public because nobody can see that with the naked eye. <br/><br/> A very powerful technology that can see more than the naked eye, even upon very close inspection, is required.  Thus, such a search will likely be unconstitutional without a warrant.</p>
<h2>Do Not Consent To An Iris Scan</h2>
<p>If you agree to have your iris scanned for identification purposes, you give up any chance you had of fighting the constitutionality of a warrantless iris scan.  Simply stating that you do not consent to having an iris scan taken should be sufficient.</p>
<h2>Don't Let Them Scan Your Face Either</h2>
<p>These same devices are also capable of scanning faces for identification purposes.  Preventing these scans is a bit more complicated because your face, and the ability to recognize you from your face, is most definitely held out to the public in plain view. <br/><br/> To prevent face scanning requires knowing at what point in a police encounter the face scan is taking place.  Knowing this will help you to know if you must submit or if you are free to leave.</p>
<h2>Ignore The Police:  "Free To Leave" Encounters</h2>
<p>Police may stop people on the street in what is known as a "consensual" encounter for no reason at all.  Police could potentially ask you for a face (or iris) scan during this "consensual" encounter.<br/><br/> If you reasonably think you are free to leave you can ignore everything the police are saying and just walk away. (<a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=14806767433216666666&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2&amp;as_vis=1&amp;oi=scholarr" target="_blank">Florida v. Royer</a>; <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=16978852357758067713&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2&amp;as_vis=1&amp;oi=scholarr" target="_blank">Michigan v. Chesternut</a><em></em><em></em>). <br/><br/> If you aren't sure, or you just want to be polite, one of the best things you can say is "am I free to leave or am I being detained?"  Stopping the encounter as soon as possible before a scan of your face can be required is the best way to prevent a facial scan.  If you aren't free to go, you are being detained.</p>
<h2>Detention</h2>
<p>To detain you, the police need reasonable suspicion based on articulable facts that you are, have been, or will be committing a crime.  (<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/historics/USSC_CR_0392_0001_ZO.html" target="_blank">Terry v. Ohio</a>)  If a reasonable person thinks that they aren't free to go, they are being detained.  (<a href="http://supreme.justia.com/us/446/544/case.html" target="_blank">United States v. Mendenhall</a>)<em></em>.  Here is where it gets a bit tricky. Some states permit you to remain silent to questions at this point, but many require you to at least provide your name.  (<a href="http://law.cornell.edu/supct/html/03-5554.ZO.html" target="_blank">Hiibel v. 6th Judicial District Court of Nevada</a>)<em></em>  If you are in a no name state, you may be able to refuse a facial scan.  This will probably make the police pretty mad so it might not be recommended.  In states where your name is required, there is probably nothing you can do.</p>
<h2>Arrest</h2>
<p>If the police then have probable cause to believe you committed a crime, they may arrest you.  They will take you into the mug shot room where a long line of celebrities have taken their most memorable photos. <br/><br/> At this point, there is nothing you can do to keep the police from putting your face in their facial recognition database.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Warrantless, unconsensual iris scans are probably unconstitutional.  Face scans aren't as inherently unconstitutional, but can still be prevented.  If you are a law abiding citizen, these, and other tips from <a href="http://www.howtovanish.com/htvbookaddtocart">HowToVanish</a>, can help you protect more of your privacy from one of the worst invasions of privacy that exist, police encounters.</p>
