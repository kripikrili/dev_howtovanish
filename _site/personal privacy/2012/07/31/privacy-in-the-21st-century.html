								<p><strong>[pullquote]Truly, the world of civil liberties is in commotion but the power of technology is in forward motion like never before.[/pullquote]</strong><a title="political privacy in the 21st century" href="http://www.howtovanish.com/2012/07/privacy-in-the-21st-century/" target="_blank">Political privacy in the 21st century</a> is becoming an extremely sensitive issue. We find traditional strengths collapsing or falling short without proactive solutions being applied.</p>
<p>These tend to happen gradually until something snaps our attention or brings an under-appreciated aspect into focus. Maintaining higher expectations or taking control of our privacy instead of blindly yielding to constant unconstitutional infringements by governmental bodies is essential. Plus, individuals should loudly voice their opinions and concerns when they feel to.</p>
<p>Authentic communication is the foundation for a productive and peaceful society. In a world of open and instant communication those who want to occupy positions of power and authority and act with integrity and morality should have nothing to fear from the spread of ideas.</p>
<p>However, long term avoidance of addressing thorny political issues has led to an impending crisis of ginormous proportion. All those things that are important are being suffocated and paralyzed because of legitimate fears and is hindering the natural evolutionary process of life and culture. It is in this vacuum of moral and ethical leadership that each individual can project their voice to overcome generational problems.</p>
<p>For example, there were no weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, Obama has targeted and assassinated over 160 children, Social Security is a bankrupt Ponzi scam, warrantless wiretapping is taking place on a massive scale, political persecution is more popular than ever and freedom of speech is being attacked like never before. Truly, the world of civil liberties is in commotion but the power of technology is in forward motion like never before.</p>
<p>One's political privacy in the 21st century can often feel like a sacrificial issue. <a title="domestic security measures" href="http://www.howtovanish.com/2012/07/domestic-security-measures" target="_blank">Domestic security measures</a> in most countries and places bring a recurrent law to the informational provisions for maintaining privacy. Volunteering personal aspects and privacy issues can be quite a challenge when stepping into direct conflict with administrative busybodies. Individuals continue attempting to shield their right to being left alone. But such is the life of a slave to the nation-state.</p>
<p>[HTML1]</p>
<p><strong>FREE AND INDEPENDENT</strong></p>
<p>But mankind, at least those who choose to, will be what they were born to be: Free and Independent. The force multiplying <a title="privacy tools" href="http://www.howtovanish.com/privacy-tools-and-resources/" target="_blank">privacy tools</a> of the Information Age are available to all. This definitely raises issues in every country about where the theories of research psychology, evolutionary science of identification, DNA tests, human relationship views, the mass scale shifts in communication technologies, high level technological advancement with encryption or information technology and overall <a title="protecting privacy in the digital age" href="http://www.howtovanish.com/2012/05/protecting-privacy-in-the-digital-age" target="_blank">privacy protection in the digital age</a>.</p>
<p><strong>[pullquote]But who will watch the watchers?[/pullquote]</strong>Violent crime levels have been decreasing in many areas and yet there has been further extension of certain paranoid cultures leading to more closely watched or privacy invasive levels of communication surveillance amongst the growing technological advancements.</p>
<p>With a decreasingly legitimate threat coupled with <a title="agent provocateurs" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agent_provocateur" target="_blank">agent provocateurs</a> it lends credence to rooted layers of conspiracy theory which further undermines the usefulness or value that the State adds, if any. Instead, it is viewed as a great hindrance and scourge to mankind and peaceful society.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.--That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, --That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness. Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shewn, that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security. [<a title="declaration of independence" href="http://www.archives.gov/exhibits/charters/declaration_transcript.html" target="_blank">The Declaration of Independence</a>]</p>
<p>Which leaves you with the most important thing to do: declare your independence. This requires no signing of a document or other busybody paperwork. In the quiet of your own mind make the decision to no longer be a slave of the nation state. In other words, recognize the authority of your own sovereignty and withdraw your consent from the Colossus. Then do everything you can to <a title="starving the vampire squid" href="http://www.runtogold.com/2009/11/starving-the-vampire-squids/" target="_blank">starve the vampire squid beast</a>.</p>
<p>Hopefully, you now understand the concept of political privacy in the 21st century.
