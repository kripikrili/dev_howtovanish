<p>New law forces companies to collect data H.R. 1981</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Data can be valuable to companies but it can also be a liability. Maintaining vast amounts of juicy targets fro theft means high security costs and potential lawsuits for negligence. It can lao mean expenses responses to subpoenas for records.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To reduce these costs and risks, some businesses choose to implement a plan of data retention whoch allows them to purge their records of unnecessary data. If there is no data to steal, there is no risk of theft. If there is no data to accidentally release, there is no risk of lawsuit, and if there is no data that is responsive to a subpoena, the subpoena process is much easier and less expensive.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Destroying potential evidence is a no-no, but following a pre-set plan is ok.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now cogress has passed a new law that requires internet service providers to retain data about their customers internet activity for one year. This means that there will now be a mandatory database that includes a lot of very revealing information.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is concerning for the supposedly legitimate uses of the information. Law enforcement, and marketers could mine the vast amounts of data which would be extremely revealing about an individual. This is the no fly list on steroids.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many innocent people, like students, academics or journalists visiting the same illicit sites fro research would be caught up in the data mining pools.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Political speech (or learning about politics) will never be free because it will be constantly surveilled, whistleblowers will not be able to reveal crimes and corruption, especially if the ISP are the ones guilty of crime or corruption.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>PLus, there will no doubt be illicit uses by legitimate users to intimidate politically, police officers will harass, and political opponents will be blackmailed or silenced. There is no need for a warrant or probable cause to get access to this data. There are many other methods provided for obtaining the information that are well short of this requirement. 18 USC 2703</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This means that every ISP will have information about every user that is valuable to a host of illegitimate users, thieves, hackers, marketers, identity thieves, censors, oppressive regimes, dictators all have a lot of incentive to get access to that information. When it is stored in one p,ace, it becomes very easy for them to get it. All they need is 1 rogue employee of the ISP, 1 lucky hack into the system, or 1 mistake by the system operators. The ISPs protecting the data have to be right all the time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are already ways to effectively limit how much information your own ISP has about you. Use Tor for sensitive or every day internet use. Use a VPN to connect to a server outside of the US where traffic logs are not necessary and are not recorded. You can also use a VPN whose company is not based in the US for even stronger protection because it makes it more difficult to obtain that information by coercive means.</p>
