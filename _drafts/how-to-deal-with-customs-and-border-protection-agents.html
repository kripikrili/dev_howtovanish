<p><strong>[pullquote]To help you develop a logical, rational and preplanned way to approach the conversation with Customs and Border Protection officers we have put together this helpful guide Exercise Your Right To Remain Silent With U.S. Customs Agents.[/pullquote]</strong>I am writing this from a deep, dark oubliette beneath Miami International Airport. I decided to have a confrontion with Customs and Border Protection and this is where I ended up. From my story you will learn how to properly interact with these federal officers.</p>
<p>It all started a month ago. There was a tremendously good offer for a round-trip flight to Buenos Aires from Miami that included a round-trip ticket from Buenos Aires to anywhere in Argentina. Since I could not pass up such a good deal I bought it and have spent the last month touring the beautiful Argentina.</p>
<p>The flight from Buenos Aires to Miami departed at 11:25PM. So when I was tired when we arrived at 8:40AM. The last thing I wanted to do was deal with 'officers sent forth to harass and eat out of our substance.' I quickly phased through passport control and picked up my one checked bag. Usually I do not check baggage but I Â did not feel like carrying it around and the layover in Miami was about 5 hours so I figured there was nothing to lose. Then I trotted towards the otherwise empty gauntlet manned by four Customs and Border Protection officers that stood between me and the non-federal government polluted Floridian air.</p>
<p>[pullquote]So go ahead and be a patriotic American by exercising your right to remain silent instead of rolling over like some abused dog![/pullquote]This is where it got fun because I knew I had about 5 hours of extra time with no pressure of a close connection and the interaction would make great fodder for this blog. So I approached Officer BumpOnALog who seemed bored and it appeared I was his newest mouse to torment. As instructed by the sign I handed him the customs declaration. Now, when dealing with government actors there is a line to walk between disclosure and convenience. The conversation with annotation:</p>
<p>Officer BumpOnALog: And where are you coming from? (question is asked on the form)</p>
<p>Response: Argentina. (Truthful response as recorded on the form)</p>
<p>Officer BumpOnALog: And how long were you there? (unjustified question but still fairly reasonable inquiry to satisfy so I responded)</p>
<p>Response: About three weeks.</p>
<p>Officer BumpOnALog: And what were you doing there? (question is asked on the form)</p>
<p>Response: Tourist. (Truthful response as recorded on the form)</p>
<p>Officer BumpOnALog: All alone or do you have friends or family there? (unjustified question but still fairly reasonable inquiry as the family question is asked on the form which I responded none and he is likely asking with intent to gather additional facts or misstatements)</p>
<p>Response: Alone, I have friends there. (Truthful and 'friends' is very vague but corroborates the tourist statement)</p>
<p>Officer BumpOnALog: And where are you headed? (question is asked on the form)</p>
<p>Response: To XXXXX. (Truthful response as recorded on the form)</p>
<p>Officer BumpOnALog: How are you employed there? (unjustified leading question which presumes a fact not already in evidence from the conversation but is still a fairly reasonable inquiry to satisfy so I responded)</p>
<p>Response: Real estate. (In my circumstances it is truthful but extremely vague).</p>
<p>Officer BumpOnALog: And how is the market up there? (small talk but still interrogation with intent to gather additional facts for inconsistency in my responses)</p>
<p>Response: Very bad.</p>
<p>Officer BumpOnALog: And you just spent three weeks in Argentina? (confrontation of my truthfulness to previous answers. Implying that because I am in real estate, the real estate market is bad where I am at and I just took a three week vacation to Buenos Aires therefore I am being incomplete or untruthful about the purposes of my trip)</p>
<p>Response: Am I being detained or am I free to go? (being extremely annoyed with his implications, almost in my sleep I whip out this standard and most trustworthy response and slap him across the face with it. In other words, This conversation is over.)</p>
<p>Officer BumpOnALog: Uhh, Uhhh, no.</p>
<p>Response: Oh, then which way should I go? (I take a step towards the closest exit)</p>
<p>Officer BumpOnALog: Over to 15. (But like a spurned girlfriend or boyfriend who just can't leave you alone, out of spite he uses what meager amount of power he has left to slightly inconvenience my life.)</p>
<p>[pullquote]Changes are you will not end up in the oubliette.[/pullquote]So I head over to door 15 which leads to the completely empty, except for 4-5 officers, secondary Customs and Border Protection area. I encountered another officer who asked similar questions which received simliar responses and took about one minute. Then I had to put my bag through the standard agricultural inspection machine, pick it up and walk through the exit. Adios amigos!</p>
<p>MORAL OF THE STORY</p>
<p>Dealing with government officials can be stressful for many people especially if they do not have a logical, rational and preplanned way to approach the conversation. But there are still many legal checks and balances so citizens can wield tremendous power during the interaction. The key is to do so in a calm, polite and respectful way with an edge of boldness.</p>
<p>By flexing my rights I terminated the conversation when I wanted to but still faced a slight five minute inconvenience by being forced to go through the secondary screening process. Keep in mind the border is one of the most legally invasive areas in that most standard 4th Amendment protections do not apply because of the lack of a reasonable expectation of privacy. This is part of the tradeoff between disclosure and convenience. In my case I had plenty of extra time, did not see any point in continuing the conversation and because I was tired and not at peak mental capacity saw a potential of possibly making an inadvertent misstatement which, if circumstances were different, could lead to some extremely serious or uncomfortable consequences. So I chose to flex my rights and get a little more experience dealing with government officials.</p>
<p>You see if you flex your rights then your backbone will get stronger. If you waive your rights then your backbone will turn to gelatinous goop. Then when you need to flex your rights you will not longer have the ability to do so. Why not practice when you have nothing to lose? Chances are you will not end up in an oubliette.</p>
<p>To help you develop a logical, rational and preplanned way to approach the conversation with Customs and Border Protection officers we have put together this helpful guide Exercise Your Right To Remain Silent With U.S. Customs Agents. If you print it off then this smaller portion should fit comfortably inside your passport.</p>
<p>Sure, instead of just the secondary inspection I received you could also get a very thorough search of you and your stuff. By flexing your rights you may be inconvienced. But it can also be fun and keep in mind that the more people who invoke and flex their rights the less Customs will be able to infringe on them. Thus I recommend you pass copies of the guide to your family, friends and perhaps even all the other passengers on the plane. The Customs and Border Protection will have a heck of a time searching everyone!</p>
<p>Remember, the Customs and Border Protection officers work for us. So go ahead and be a patriotic American by exercising your right to remain silent instead of rolling over like some abused dog!</p>
