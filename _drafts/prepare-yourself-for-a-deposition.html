<p>Having your deposition taken is horrible.  It means you are either involved in a lawsuit or you are a witness.    Most people don't wake up in the morning hoping for that.</p>
<p>Depos can be long and very boring.</p>
<p>If you are involved in the suit, you are probably being deposed to probe your case for weaknesses.  I doubt you ask for that for Christmas.</p>
<p>There may be a lot of personal or business information that you don't want to reveal.  Either it is embarrassing, or, it could be damaging to your case.</p>
<p>But, that information is only going to come out if you volunteer it or if the opposing attorney asks for it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
