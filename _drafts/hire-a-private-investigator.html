<p>Do you worry about what people know about you?  Do you ever wonder what private and personal information of yours is actually available to anyone who is interested?</p>
<p>If you are then you won't be able to be comfortable until you know exactly what information is out there.  In this digital age, where everything from your home address, to your gym membership, to your most private personal information is available online, usually for free.</p>
<p>If your personal information, or reputation is important to you, or if you are just curious because it is a big unknown that is keeping you up at night, how important would it be to you to find out?</p>
<p>Maybe you haven't done anything to protect your privacy at all and you just realized that it might be a problem.  You might want to know just how exposed you are.</p>
<p>Maybe you have taken significant steps to protect your privacy and you want to know how good of a job you, or the person you hired, is doing and see what other loose ends you have to tie up.</p>
<p>Maybe you are somewhere in between.</p>
<p>In any case, you need to know what someone can find about you.  What better way to do that than to get a person who looks that information up for a living to find out for you, before a stranger, a potential employer, or a potential plaintiff, finds that out and lets you know the hard way.</p>
<p>Not only can having that personal information available to the public unnerving, but it can affect employment opportunities.  Employers will often do a background search to see what information they can find about you.  The higher profile the employer, the deeper they are going to search.   Government agencies, large corporations and others will dig up as much as they can.</p>
<p>But they don't have the right to that information, they are only entitled to the information they can find, so it is up to you to control what they can find out about you.</p>
<p>But how will you know what information can be found.</p>
<p>Here is where a private investigator can be a lifesaver.</p>
<p>A private investigator can actually help you find the information that is out there on you.  But that's not everything.  With his expertise in searching combined with my expertise in privacy, we will give you an outline of the top things that you can do to specifically remove items from that list, minimize the impact, and make the trail to you grow cold.</p>
<p>If you really want to know what a private investigator can find out about you, hire one and see what they find.  Then use that information to start removing information, or creating false trails.</p>
